              At the WashU Medical School, students are required to document
              their patient encounters through the student portal. While the
              data-entry task is supposed to be simple, the faculty has found
              that a majority of students find it overburdening, resulting in
              inaccurate reports.

              responsible data entry for very busy medical students

            Why do medical schools require students to enter patient log in the
            first place?
          </h4>
          <p class="a page-paragraph">
            Documentation is an essential and important feature of patient care
            and learning how and what to document is an important part of
            medical education. Keeping this log becomes a student training
            exercise in documentation. All of these features of documentation
            -<b>
              seriousness, accuracy, conscientiousness and honesty </b
            >- are measures of professionalism. ––– TAMU Medical School
          </p>
          <h3>
            Do the medical students understand the rational behind this mandatory documentation? 
          </h3>
          <p class="a page-paragraph">“<b>Annoying busy work.</b> It’s purely administrative, and just for attendance purpose. The whole process could potentially just be automated through the EMR system.”</p>

            One interesting we found during our interview was that
            Comparing to digital devices, student stick to paper as their main
            medium during patient visits. sometimes they would use a piece of
            scrap paper to write down patient information and they lose those
            paper. As a result, making up faulty patient information when
            entering into the system Rather than introducing a new medium such
            as a new app on their phone, we wanted to stick to what the students
            are used to the most- pen and paper. We decided to design a notebook
            specifically for these busy students
